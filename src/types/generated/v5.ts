 * * `data`: The input data to pass to the contract constructor.
 * * `salt`: Used for the address derivation. See [`Pallet::contract_address`].
 * 
 * Instantiation is executed as follows:
 * 
 * - The supplied `code` is instrumented, deployed, and a `code_hash` is created for that
 *   code.
 * - If the `code_hash` already exists on the chain the underlying `code` will be shared.

 * - The smart-contract account is created at the computed address.
 * - The `value` is transferred to the new account.
 * - The `deploy` function is executed in the context of the newly-created account.
